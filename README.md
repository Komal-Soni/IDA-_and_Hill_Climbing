Problem statement
To prevent floods in Chennai, the city has designed a water channel network that interconnects various locations in the town. Each channel is a pathway that water can flow
through, connecting two different locations finally leading to the Sea. Each location has gates
to regulate the flow of water (Open /Close) and only one gate from any location to the
sea can be open. The network is represented as a graph where locations are nodes, and channels
are edges connecting these nodes. The water channels are unidirectional, meaning water can
travel only in one direction in a channel.
1. Find the shortest path from a designated water discharge start location (source node)
to a target location ie the Sea (destination node). This is crucial for emergency
response.
2. Efficiently plan the route for inspection and maintenance crews to visit every location
in the network at least once, ensuring the health and safety of the water channel system.
